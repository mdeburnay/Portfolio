            In my most recent role as an IT Recruitment Consultant for a leading
            consultancy, I consistently had meaning conversations and meetings
            with seasoned IT professionals, ranging from those in Development
            and Architecture, Programme and Project Management, to the CIO and
            CTO.

            It was through these engagements that my interest and curiosity
            around technology piqued; in an age where technology is a growing
            innovator and driving force for businesses globally, being part of
            something that consistently reinvents and builds upon the way we
            operate at a corporate and social level, and having the opportunity
            to consistently learn and develop throughout my career seemed like
            an incredibly exciting prospect.
